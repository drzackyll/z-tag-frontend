# Z-Tag
What is Z-Tag?

Z-Tag is a geolocation-based zombie ARG. Users log in and place markers each day to accumulate points. Each user is either a human or a zombie. You will not know where other users are placing their markers until the next day.

Humans want to stay away from zombies to avoid infection. For safety, try to place your marker near where you think other humans are. Your score increases for each day you survive.

Zombies, on the other hand, have an insatiable hunger for human flesh. They also want to place their markers near humans, but not for safety. They hunger for sweet, sweet people meat. Also, your score increases with each human infected.

If a human is infected, they become a zombie. It is inevitable that in time all human life will be consumed, and the sum of our accomplishments forgotten. Our cities, our science, our culture, all nought but dust...

Anyway, get some meaningless points and enjoy.
